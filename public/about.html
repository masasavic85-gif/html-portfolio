<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently learning web development and building my first websites. I enjoy understanding how things work behind the scenes and turning ideas into simple, functional pages.</p>

<p>Besides coding, I enjoy learning new skills, exploring ideas and creating something unique.
  I believe curiosity is the starting point for creating meaningful and thoughtful work.

<p>This website is part of my learning journey, where I practice new skills and experiment with code. I'm excited to keep improving and learning more every day.</p>
